    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     13
      Number with same-slice register load:      5
      Number with same-slice carry load:         8
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,328 out of   2,278   58%
  Nummber of MUXCYs used:                      444 out of   4,556    9%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        4,635
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,417 out of   4,635   30%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             158 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
